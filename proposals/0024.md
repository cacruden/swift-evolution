# Feature Change: Demux Operator (aka Generalized Ternary)

* Proposal: [SE-NNNN](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/NNNN-name.md)
* Author(s): [Paul Ossenbruggen](https://github.com/possen)
* Status: **Review**
* Review manager: TBD

## Introduction

The key advantage of the ternary operator is that is a very concise way of assigning a result from two expressions based upon a true-false control input. This proposal extends that notion to support more than two outcomes and allowing that to work with types other than just boolean and by pulling in some concepts from *switch* and *if*. This proposal adds powerful capabilities to that existing construct and tries to come up with something that is truely better than the venerable ternary operator by taking its best aspects and extending it.        

Swift-evolution thread: [ternary operator ?: suggestion](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20151207/000810.html)

## Motivation

Currently, it is a not very easy to set a value as the result evaluting a switch using statements. Each case is a local scope which can't be used after the statement unless declared before the statement. Because of this, binding a variable or constant is not a single step process and type inference can not be used to determine the type which is especially painful in Swift. This syntax streamlines that process of binding and inferring the type when you have a variable that can change depending on the value of a switch statement, it also allows you to assign the result of one of many expressions based upon an input. It should also reduce redundant code in each branch of the switch compared to the statement form. Also this proposal helps to unify the concepts of a switch expression and ternary. The existing ternary only supports the *Bool* type as it selector. In addtion to these features, it also reduces some syntax problems with the current ternary. This allows any enumerable type. Finally, container types for the input have the potential to add even more power to the demux operator. 

## Proposed solution

Note, please hear me out, and see **Alternatives Considered** section before rejecting this as making Ternary worse. 

#### Background 

The ternary **"?:"** is an area of much debate because it is perceived as hard to understand for novices. I believe that as with anything it may be a little hard to understand at first it can be quite benefitial in many situations. In addition it has many benefits that can not be ignored when desiging something that attempts to improve upon it. There are many concepts in Swift that take a little getting used to before they click, such as patterns in *switch* statements.

Ternary benefits:
* It avoids large blocks of indented *if* or *switch* statements but it also allows you to indent if you prefer.
* Very concise format, essentially 2 characters. 
* Pops out from text in a way that keywords do not.
* Can be put into places where a statement could not
* Can select from two expressions on a single line.
* Nests well (but best not to over use this). 
* Ensures that both sides of the result are of compatible type. 
* It is clear that it will provide a result on each branch in a way that a statement never could. Statements are not obliged to return anything. 
* Most coming from C based languages are familiar with it. 

Downsides:
* Can't easily be searched on the web. (This proposal will remedy that). 
* Harder for novices to understand
* *if..then..else* are easier to understand for novices. 
* Can only handle bool as the control parameter. (this proposal addressses that). 
* Sometimes hard to see where ternary begins and ends. Many put parenthesis around it to help with this. 

#### Overview

First, I will say that ternary is not removed in this proposal, it will continue to exist but slightly modified. This is conceptually an extension of that notion.  

The following is how you typically would write code to assign result from an enum using the *switch* statement, in this case a enum of three or more colors: 

``` swift 

  var result : Int 
  switch color { 
    case .Red: result = 0xFF0000
    case .Green: result = 0x00FF00
    case .Blue: result = 0x0000FF
    default: result = 0xFFFFFF
  }
  ```

Note that the type of result is not inferred, there is duplicated code assigning to result, it is quite a lot of code to write and for something this simple it fills mulitple lines. It also may seem that you need to use *var* when *let* will work. 

With this proposal the repeated code is eliminated, it concisely allows assignement and use type inference to bind to determine the type and bind the name. It all fits easily on one line. 

``` swift 

  let result = ?(color : .Red: 0xFF0000, .Green: 0x00FF00, .Blue: 0x0000FF, default: 0xFFFFFF)
  
  ```

The parenthesis help to group the ternary something that many do anyway by enclosing it in pararthesis which is a common complaint about the current ternary. The syntax following the colon works the same as the existing switch so *where* and pattern matching work and it also supports a list of expressions. It is not far off from the existing ternary syntax and the switch statement so it will look familiar and intuitive to those coming from other languages or even Swift. The use of parenthesis allow this to be used anywhere an existing ternary can be used. 

Key points with this syntax:
* Familiar syntax
* Utilizes the existing notions of the switch statement. 
* Supports a list of expressions as an index into which choice to make (more on this later).
* The question mark at the beginning of the brace serves to tell the developer this is a demux, somthing you can't necessarily know from a ternary. In a ternary you just see a floating conditional that does not stand out. Only when you get to the question mark and then the colon do you realize it is a ternary. 
* The parenthesis are more in line with expressions as mathematical statements than say a brace or statement would be. 
* The question mark works with the exising notion in swift of the question mark meaning that something needs to be decided here. Like nil-coalescing operators and operator chaining. 
* It is clear when the beginning and end of the demux expression is. 
* The controller input is clearly deliniated from the choices using the already familiar colon. 
* Yhe parenthesis formalizes the practice of putting them around the ternary for improved readability.
* The parenthesis also help to keep it parsable as a parameter to a function, as the commas are used to separate the list of choices. 

#### Scalar Types

Some of enum was shown in the **Overview**, I will continue a bit in some detail on enum, then cover other types of selectors.

##### (More) Enums 
As with *switch* you can specify, *default* or if every case is covered, omit the default keyword.   

For example:

``` swift
  result = ?(color : .Red: 0xFF0000, .Green: 0x00FF00, .Blue: 0x0000FF)  
```

One nice thing about this is that it follows the existing switch statement syntax, thus putting "case" in front of each is not necessary but can be done if desired. Like closure syntax not making you assign variables to every param, keeping things concise is very important. 

##### Boolean 

For booleans it is essentially the same form. For example the new format:

``` swift 
result = ?(lightState : "Blink", "Solid")
```

from the original form:

``` swift
result = lightState ? "Blink" : "Solid"
```

Of note, one might think that for a boolean false is first but in this true is first because that is most compatible and natural with the existing ternary. One advantage of this format is that the parenthesis help group the ternary which is one complaint with the original ternary operators. One downside is this is a breaking change and it sligtly deviates from C but I think it is important for consistency. 

##### Ranges

For ranges:

``` swift 
  warning = ?(intensity : case 0...30: "Nothing to Worry About",
                          case 31...50: "Maybe somthing to worry about", 
                          case 51...70: "Better start panicking", 
                          case 71...100: "Run for your lives!"
                          default: "Not telling" )
```

In addition to supporting enums and ranges, any enumerable type is supported with these forms. So for an integer you could do something like this where each value maps to a specific outcome, the nth element maps to the integer.

##### Integers

``` swift 
  character = ?(charNum : "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K", default:"Z")
```

Note that for something like an integer *default:* would be required because that is too many to cover every value of int.

#### Container Types
This could be applied the functional map and other functions.

For example, map would compose nicely with map:

```swift
["bear", "in", "the", "woods"].map(?(string : "bear": "fish", 
                                              "in": "out",
                                              "woods":"water", 
                                              default:string))
                                              
```

```swift
["fish", "out", "the", "water"]
```

> **This part is not officially part of the proposal, I put in because it may be interesting to directly allow applying a ternary on container types, but that is probably something that is not tackled for this first proposal. For example this might be useful as a future direction **: 

> In this case you are might have a dictionary that does not have the information that you want, this could allow allow you map it. At this point it is hard to say how this would be differnt than using *map*.  

> ``` swift
> [.North: "North", .South: "South", .East: "East", .West: "West"] ?(direction : .North: (  0, -1), 
                                                                               .South: (  0,  1),
                                                                               .East:  ( -1,  0),
                                                                               .West:  (  1,  0))
                                                                               
> ``` 

> One area of improvement to figure out. is to be able to switch on the value or key. I am open to suggestions on how to best accomplish that. A tuple seems natural, but not sure how to make it the switch value. 

#### Result Types

All expressions must match the result type and for type inference to determine the type, expressions must be the same result type. If you want something else it will not automatically find a more generic type, for example this would generate an error: 

``` swift
  let result = ?(value: 1: "String", 2: 52, default:  nil)
```

will not automatically create an Any? for "result". They must specify the more generic type on the left hand side. 

``` swift
    let result : Any? = ?(value: 1: "String", 2: 52, default:  nil)
```

### Conclusion 

This proposal haa quite a few advantages it addresses the following things:
* now you can search ?( in a search engine and get results back where the old ternary you could
* compact syntax
* help grouping with ?( ) syntax, something that many do already
* Visually distingushes itsself 
* more powerful allows switching base upon more than just boolean types
* This should have real benefits to functional programmers where imperative approaches are not as desirable. This proposal furthers that capability.  

I think this the best balance of familiarity, compactness, power that can be acheived.

## Detailed design
TODO: needs work!
### Grammar:

``` swift
  result = ?(control-expression : pattern case label1: expression1, label2: expression2, ... labelN: expressionN, default: expression)  
```

``` swift
  result = ?(enumerable-expression : expression1, ... expressionN, default:expression )  
```
An extended ternary expression allows certain different expressions to be executed depending on the value of a control expression.

An extended ternary expression has the following form:

```
 ?( control-expression : 
    case pattern 1: expression1, 
           pattern 2 where condition: expression,
    case  pattern 3 where condition: expression,
           pattern 4 where condition: expression,
    default:
           expression
  )
```

Only newly defined grammars are presented here. See Swift switch statement grammar for the existing grammars: 

```
switch-expression → ?(expression : switch-expression-cases)

switch-expression-cases switch-expression-case switch-expression-cases

switch-expression-case case-label expression | default-label expression
```

"switch" expression results must be a compatible type of the result. 

### Pattern Matching: 

All the current pattern matching abilities of switch statments should be present for example. "where" clauses. 

## Impact on existing code

The existing ternary will need to be transformed into the new format. The converter tool will need to make that change. I could have continued to allow the original form, in fact, that was my intention when I started this proposal, but for consistency it is imporant to make a breaking change. However, if that would cause it to not be accepted then would be willing to allow both forms. I think the benefits of this approach warrant a breaking change. It is not different just to be different but to unify some concepts and provide powerful new capabilities.  

## Alternatives considered

### Why not extend existing statements to be usable as expressions?

In a statement block it is common to not have return values. So you could make it an expression if the return value is used. This makes it more complex from both the programming model and the compiler perspective. 

Another problem is the proliferation of braces, expressions should be light, it looks cumbersome to have braces all through your expressions. It does not look as clean having braces in an expression as braces are usually used to group blocks of staements. Further it will help reinforce the difference between an expression and a statement to only use braces for statements. For example all the extra braces in this case are harder to read:

``` swift
let color = switch enumColor {
  case .Red: (switch shade {case .DarkRed: 0xFFEEEE
                            case .LightRed:0xFF0000
                            default: 0xFF1010 } )
  default: 0xFFFFFF
}
```

note that the commas for each case are not necessary with this example but does look significanly more like Lisp :-)

If you look at the language grammar there is a clear separation between what is an expression vs a statement. It would be too large a change to try to unifiy expressions and statements. See thread for examples. 

Finally switch statements can have multiple statements after them, that is not the case for expressions, only one sub-expression can be in each part of the case. There is ambiguity as to the return value if this was a statement: 


``` swift
let color = switch enumColor {
  case .Red: (switch shade {case .Dark: func1() 
                                  x = 15 
                                  40 
                            case .Light: func3() 
                                  13
                                  x = 10
                            default: func2()
                            } )
  default: 0xFFFFFF
}
```

If changing statements into expressions is what is decided, then this seems like a far bigger change and beyond the scope of this proposal and this proposal should be declined. This proposal is likely far more straightforward to add to the existing language than making statements into expressions. 

### I thought we were trying to get rid of ternary!

I went down this path and even wrote two draft proposals one for if..then..else one for switch expressions, I tried using my proposal and found it was much harder to use and did not really help with readablity as was hoped. Here are some of the reasons: 

* You could not simply put it in a function argument, the way you can with the ternary operator. 
* It muddies the concepts of statements and expressions. The programming model would fundamentally change. 
* Using *if* and *switch* implies formatting that we really don't want in an expression context. 
* Simple one liners are not possible
* It went from 2 to 10 characters, much more typing.
* readablity was not much better, the operators pop out much better in source.
* It created a problem where it was confusing that for the statement form  if cond { } else { } might require *then* if cond then {} else {}. Do we make *then* optional for statements? It does not fit with the existing swift model where the brace comes immediatly after the conditional.  
* Keywords don't stand out as well and they imply indenting which rules out quick single liners.
* I was pretty sure it would be rejected by the community because it was different but not necesarily better than the ternary operator, I believe this proposal is better than the existing ternary, due to the support for muliple types and more flexibilty.  

### why not use *switch* or *if* keyword that returns a value?

Went down this path. This looks strange to me:

``` swift
let val = if contr { X } else { Y } 
```

this is esstially a statement which argues it should be formatted like this and which is not compact:

``` swift
let val = if contr {
  X 
} else { 
  Y 
} 
```
Plus if and switch have an equal to their left, pretty non intuitive. Look at all those braces!

### Why not use some other keyword where you can control formatting?

I tried this with *pick*...*from* The idea is that by introducing new keywords the format had no preconceived notions. 

In addition to the community response being non existant, it does not fit the compactness goals:

```swift

let x = pick cond from 4, 8

```

It did feel like it was kinda on the right track to me. So I kept going.

### How about some new operator, lets call it the *Selector Operator* like ->>? 

This also does not have the preconceived notions and we can control how it looks. Boy, I really thought I had it now! 

``` swift
let a = sel ->> .Red: 1, .Green: 2, .Blue: 3 
let b = sel ->> .Red: 1, .Green: 2, .Blue: 3, default: 4
let c = sel ->> case .Red: 1, case .Green: 2, case .Blue: 3, default: 4
let d = sel ->> .Red: 1, (sel ->> .Sun: .Yellow, .Moon: .White, .Stars: .Twinkle), .Green: 2, .Blue: 3, default: 4
let e = sel ->> cases: .Red: 1, case .Green: 2, case .Blue: 3, default: 4
```

But looking at this it kind of lacks structure, it is kind of hard to tell where the ternary is.

I have done my best to address as many of these issues as possible, with I believe, a lot of success, every solution has some compromises these are the ones not addressed with this proposal:

* It deviates from C standard a little
* It is still a bit ugly as ternary as always been but I believe sliglty better due to grouping. 
* It still uses question mark which, I am not sure can be avoided, but maybe that is ok as Austin Zheng said: 

When discussing the notion that ? is only for Optionals Austin Zheng expressed this opinion: 

> In terms of semantics: The argument was made earlier that "?" is associated closely with optionals and not suitable for this purpose; I disagree: "?"'s overarching meaning is that of uncertainty or querying, which makes sense both in terms of control flow (predicate determines which way to go), as well as optionals (whose 'empty or not' status is unknown until explicitly checked for, e.g. via if-let).

> <cite> -- Austin Zheng </cite>

In Responding I said: 

> Again when looking at the nil-coalescing operator, implicit unwrapping (!) and optional chaining, I agree. It seems that the ternary operator fits quite nicely with ? meaning this is a question and that notion is encoded repeated thorough the Swift language. ? is almost a key concept in the language and making it keywords takes away from that and it seems even more wise to keep as is because it was a good design from the start. I also see why Chris and others haven’t really wanted to get into this discussion, but wisely let it happen so we could come to the same conclusion. It is almost as if ? and ! are the core concepts of the language for new Swift learners. 

Another excercise was to take a complex nested ternary expression, Paul Ossenbruggen wrote:

> Agreed, I was thinking to I really want turn something that was 2 characters into 10 and will I really be happy with that at the end of the day. A properly formatted ternary can be quite easy to read, it is when people get sloppy and try to cram too much into one expression that they get really hard to follow. For example,

Responding to the switch expresion proposal which this proposal combines Charles Constant said: 

> At the moment, the alternatives are, what, using a dict to map values? trying to shoehorn a corrsponding set of values into an enum? using the existing switch statement (pretty verbose in Swift, due to "let" scope etc)? In my own Swift code, I have encountered situations, frequently, where I wished I had an equivalent to a ternary condition that handled more than two values. Chaining multiple ternary conditions together is unreadable. This proposed Switch assignment expression would take care of that. 

> Definitely has my vote!

When discussing the replacement of ternary operator Chris Lattner said: 

> To be clear, I’m not completely opposed to a change here, but it has been discussed extensively before, and didn’t turn up any good ideas either.  That doesn’t mean that a good idea isn’t out there - it might be a very hard problem (of course, it really might be that ?: cannot be beat just because it is established, and anything as good as it but different would be considered “weird and not better”).

> <cite>-- Chris Lattner</cite> 

In response to the if..then...else expression proposal, not this proposal Austin said this: 

> I am strongly against this proposal.

> In terms of clarity: Paul Cantrill made the very good point in a different thread that "beginner-friendly" syntax may not be the same as syntax optimized for the productivity of developers working on serious projects. I think this is a great example of that principle in action. Sigils stand out to the eye when scanning code in a way that keywords don't, even in an IDE with syntax highlighting (and the perils of relying upon relying upon color have been discussed pretty thoroughly in the mandatory 'self' thread). Replacing them with keywords makes it harder to delineate the arguments.

> In terms of semantics: The argument was made earlier that "?" is associated closely with optionals and not suitable for this purpose; I disagree: "?"'s overarching meaning is that of uncertainty or querying, which makes sense both in terms of control flow (predicate determines which way to go), as well as optionals (whose 'empty or not' status is unknown until explicitly checked for, e.g. via if-let).
