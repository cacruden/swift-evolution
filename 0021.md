## Introduction

The ternary operator has existed in C like languages for some time. For anyone reading it, who is not familiar with it, it is hard to understand what its purpose is, however it provides an important feature, which is creating an expression based upon a conditional expression result.

Swift-evolution thread: [ternary operator ?: suggestion ](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20151207/000810.html)

## Motivation

The main purpose is to replace the ternary operator with something that reads better. With this approach type inference can figure out what to initially conditionally assign a variable, with statements this is not possible. Statements can also consist of multiple statements, which is not possible with an expression. 

## Proposed solution

#### Background:

Expressions and statements are inherently different. For example, in a statement it is perfectly fine to have no "else" clause but in an expression it must always have "else" to provide a result for the variable being assigned. Statements can consist of multiple lines of statements where expressions can not. Trying to make the existing statements into expressions will add complexity, clutter, harder to implement and will be confusing to users. Please see "Alternatives Considered" section for details. 

Other functional languages, such as Haskell, use the if...then...else construct and require the else part in the expression. Likewise the current ternary operator requires the "else" part after the colon. This should be thought of as a replacement of the ternary operator with keywords. 

#### Overview 

First the ternary "?:" operators are removed from the language, replaced with the if...then...else expression, (the language conversion tools would automate this process). For example:

``` swift
  result = if condition then expression1 else expression2 
```  

where the if...then...else clause requires all three keywords. This will help to differentiate it from a statement. 

Note that any of these expressions can be surrounded by parenthesis to make clear that the expression returns a value but it is not required. 

``` swift
  let color = (if stop then Color.red else Color.green)  
```

Nesting of expressions is supported providing "else if" like capabilities. 

``` swift
  let color = if stop then (if !broken then Color.red else Color.blinkinRed) else 
              (if changing then Color.yellow else Color.green)  
```


## Detailed design

### Grammar:

#### If...then...else expression

``` swift
   if condition then expression-used-if-true else expression-used-if-false 
```  

"else" is required.
```
 if-expression â†’ if condition then expression else expression 
```

"if" expression results must be a compatible type of the result. 



## Impact on existing code

All places where the ternary operator is used would need to be replaced with if...then...else. The Convert To Latest Swift Syntax in Xcode would ease this transition. 

## Alternatives considered

### Why not extend existing statements to be usable as expressions?

The biggest question was why does Swift not already support the result of the "if" statement or "switch" as part of the existing staement? You could simply allow:

``` swift
let result = if conditional { X } else { Y }. 
```

The problem with this is that in expressions all cases must be handled. In a statement it is common to not have else. So you could make it an expression if the return value is used. This makes it more complex from both the user's perspective and the compiler perspective. That means that if you were to change a "if" conditional into an expression suddenly you would get an an error if the "else" part was not provided. 

Another problem is the proliferation of braces, expressions should be light, it looks cumbersome to have braces all through your expressions. It does not look as clean having braces in an expression and you would never use braces in a ternary expression. Further it will help express the difference between an expression and a statement to only use braces for statements. For example all the extra braces in this case are harder to read:

### Is it really better? Why not just keep ternary expressions?

This is a valid question, there is an advantage in compactness to ternary expressions. I however frequently hear people saying ternary should be avoided because they are hard to read. There seems to be strong support from many who dislike it. 

### Maybe keep both ternary and keywords?

This is a possiblity but I think it will fracture the language and people will need to learn both approaches anyway which does not help anyone. 

### Why add a keyword? 

"then" is required for this proposal. 

Also considered ways of not adding additional keywords. As it may be unclear when to use "then" or not, this is addressed in two ways. It is invalid to have "then" without "else" and  statements must be surrounded in braces as they can be multiple lines long. 

``` swift
  color = if conditional "string1" else "string2"  
```

This leads to syntactic ambiguity, by adding "then" that goes away. Other keywords could work but they are unlikely to be an improvement over "then". Another possibilty would be: 

``` swift
  color = if conditional : "string1" else "string2"  
```

Where the colon differentiates it but colon is drifting into the ternary operator territory. This does not read as clearly as "then". 

### Since "then" used a lot, we should be careful about taking it. 

This is a valid point, as was pointed out some libraries make heavy use of then. If really avoiding another keyword is a problem then the suggestion "do" could work but it does not work as well
