## Introduction

The ternary operator has existed in C like languages for some time. For anyone reading it, who is not familiar with it, it is hard to understand what its purpose is, however it provides an important feature, which is creating an expression based upon a conditional expression result. This proposal addresses that read-abilty shortcoming and also allows switch expressions in a compact way.

Swift-evolution thread: [ternary operator ?: suggestion ](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20151207/000810.html)

## Motivation

The main purpose is to replace the ternary operator with something that reads better and yet still maintains that functionality at the same time allow switch to be used in expression contexts. With this approach type inference can figure out what to initially conditionally assign a variable, with statements this is not possible. Statements can also consist of multiple statements, which is not possible with an expression. 

## Proposed solution

#### Background:

Expressions and statements are inherently different. For example, in a statement it is perfectly fine to have no "else" clause but in an expression it must always have "else" to provide a result for the variable being assigned. Statements can consist of multiple sub-statements where expressions can not. Trying to make the existing statements into expressions will add complexity, clutter, harder to implement and will be confusing to users. Please see "Alternatives Considered" section for details. 

#### Overview 

First the ternary "?:" operators are removed from the language, replaced with the if...then...else expression, (the language conversion tools would automate this process). For example:

``` swift
  result = if condition then expression1 else expression2 
```  

for multiline expressions (it may be useful for more complex expressions):

``` swift
  result = if condition 
        then expression1 
        else expression2
```
where the if...then...else clause requires all three keywords. This will help to differentiate it from a statement. 

The switch statement can also be treated as an expression: 

``` swift
  result = switch pattern case label1: expression1, label2: expression2, ... labelN: expressionN, default: expressionD  
```
If all case in the enum are covered the "default:" keyword can be omitted. 

For example:

``` swift
  color = switch colorEnum case .Red: 0xFF0000, .Green: 0x00FF00, .Blue: 0x0000FF, default: 0xFFFFFF  
```

for multiline expressions:

``` swift
  color = switch colorEnum 
    case    .Red: 0xFF0000, 
            .Green: 0x00FF00, 
            .Blue: 0x0000FF,
    default: 0xFFFFFF  
```

Note that any of these expressions can be surrounded by parenthesis to make clear that the expression returns a value but it is not required. 

``` swift
  let color = (switch colorEnum case .Red: 0xFF0000, .Green: 0x00FF00, .Blue: 0x0000FF, default: 0xFFFFFF)  
```

One nice thing about this is that it follows the existing switch statement syntax, thus putting "case" in front of each is not necessary. 

To make the difference between expressions and statements clear, statements will continue to require braces after the conditional and "else" if present, and expressions will not have braces. 

All expressions must match the result type and for type inference, expressions must be the same result type. If you want something else it will not automatically find a more generic type, for example this would generate an error: 

``` swift
  let result = switch value 
      case      1: "String", 
                2: 52, 
      default:  nil
```

will not automatically create an Any? for "result". They must specify the more generic type on the left hand side. 

``` swift
  let result : Any? = switch value 
      cases   1: "String", 
              2: 52, 
      default:  nil
```

## Detailed design

### Grammar:

#### If...then...else expression

``` swift
   if condition then expression-used-if-true else expression-used-if-false 
```  

"else" is required.
```
 if-expression → if condition then expression else expression 
```

if expression results must be a compatible type of the result. 

#### Switch Expression

``` swift
  result = switch pattern case label1: expression1, label2: expression2, ... labelN: expressionN, default: expressionD  
```

A switch statement allows certain different expressions to be executed depending on the value of a control expression.

A switch expression has the following form:

```
 switch control-expression 
    case pattern 1: expression1, 
           pattern 2 where condition: expression,
    case  pattern 3 where condition: expression,
           pattern 4 where condition: expression,
    default:
           expression
```

Only newly defined grammars are presented here. See Swift switch statement grammar for the existing grammars: 

```
switch-expression → switch expression switch-expression-cases

switch-expression-cases switch-expression-case switch-expression-cases

switch-expression-case case-label expression | default-label expression

```

switch expression results must be a compatible type of the result. 

### Pattern Matching for "switch": 

All the current pattern matching abilities of switch statments should be present for example. "where" clauses. 

## Impact on existing code

All places where the ternary operator is used would need to be replaced with if...then...else. The Convert To Latest Swift Syntax in Xcode would ease this transition. Everything else is optional to use. 

## Alternatives considered

### Why not extend existing statements to be usable as expressions?

The biggest question was why does Swift not already support the result of the "if" statement or "switch" as part of the existing staement? You could simply allow:

``` swift
let result = if conditional { X } else { Y }. 
```

The problem with this is that in expressions all cases must be handled. In a statement it is common to not have else. So you could make it an expression if the return value is used. This makes it more complex from both the user's perspective and the compiler perspective. That means that if you were to change a "if" conditional into an expression suddenly you would get an an error if the "else" part was not provided. 

Another problem is the proliferation of braces, expressions should be light, it looks cumbersome to have braces all through your expressions. It does not look as clean having braces in an expression and you would never use braces in a ternary expression. Further it will help express the difference between an expression and a statement to only use braces for statements. For example:

``` swift
let color = switch enumColor {
  case .Red: (switch shade {case .DarkRed: 0xFFEEEE
                            case .LightRed:0xFF0000
                            default: 0xFF1010 } )
  default: 0xFFFFFF
}
```

note that the commas for each case are not necessary with this example but does look significanly more like Lisp :-)

If you look at the language grammar there is a clear separation between what is an expression vs a statement. It would be too large a change to try to unifiy expressions and statements. See thread for examples. 

Finally switch statements can have multiple statements after them, that is not the case for expressions, only one sub-expression can be in each part of the case. There is ambiguity if the existing statement could have multiple statements in it. 

``` swift
let color = switch enumColor {
  case .Red: (switch shade {case .Dark: func1(); 
                                  x = 15 
                                  40 
                            case .Light: func3() 
                                  13 x = 10
                            default: func2()
                            } )
  default: 0xFFFFFF
}
```

### Add a new keyword "cases"?

you could make a "cases" that is interchangeable with "case": 

``` swift
  let color : Int
  switch colorEnum { 
    cases .Red: color = 0xFF0000,
          .Green: color = 0x00FF00,
          .Blue: color = 0x0000FF,
    default: color = 0xFFFFFF
  }
```
best not to add new keywords unless necessary.

### Why add a keyword? 

"then" is required for this proposal. 

Also considered ways of not adding additional keywords. As it may be unclear when to use "then" or not, this is addressed in two ways. It is invalid to have "then" without "else". Statements must be surrounded in braces as they can be multiple lines long. 

``` swift
  color = if conditional "string1" else "string2"  
```

This leads to syntactic ambiguity, by adding "then" that goes away. Other keywords could work but they are unlikely to be an improvement over "then". Another possibilty would be: 

``` swift
  color = if conditional : "string1" else "string2"  
```

Where the colon differentiates it but colon is drifting into the ternary operator territory. This does not read as clearly as "then".
