## Introduction

The ternary operator has existed in C like languages for some time. For anyone reading it, who is not familiar with it, it is hard to understand what its purpose is, however it provides an important feature, which is creating an expression based upon a conditional. This proposal addresses that shortcoming and also allows switch expressions in a compact way.   

Swift-evolution thread: [link to the discussion thread for that proposal](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20151207/000810.html)

## Motivation

The main purpose is to replace the ternary operator with something that reads better and yet still maintains that functionality at the same time allow switch to be used in expression contexts. With this approach type inference can figure out what to initally conditionally assign a variable with statements this is not possible. 

## Proposed solution

Background: expressions and statements are inheriently different. For example, in a statement it is perfectly fine to have no "else" clause but in an expression it must always have "else" to initialize the variable. Trying to make the existing statements into expressions will add complexity, clutter, and will be confusing to users. Please see "Alternatives Considered" section for details. 

First the ternary "?:" operators would be removed from the language, replaced with the if...then...else expression, the language upgrade tools would automate this. For example:

``` swift
  result = if condition then X else Y 
```  

for multiline expressions may be useful for more complex expressions:
``` swift
  result = if condition 
        then X 
        else Y 
```
where the if...then...else clause requires all three keywords. This will help to differentiate it from a statement. 

The swtich statement can also be treated as an expression: 

``` swift
  color = switch colorEnum cases: .Red: 0xFF0000, .Green: 0x00FF00, .Blue: 0x0000FF, default: 0xFFFFFF  
```

for multiline expressions:

``` swift
  color = switch colorEnum 
    cases:  .Red: 0xFF0000, 
            .Green: 0x00FF00, 
            .Blue: 0x0000FF,
    default: 0xFFFFFF  
```
if all cases in the enum are covered the default keyword can be omitted. Note that the cases keyword provides a way to list the cases after the switch more compactly. It can also be written with "case:", if preferred: 

``` swift
  color = switch colorEnum case: .Red: 0xFF0000, case .Green: 0x00FF00, case .Blue: 0x0000FF, default: 0xFFFFFF  
```  
Note that any of these expressions can be surrounded by parenthesis to make clear that the expression returns a value but it is not required. 

``` swift
  let color = (switch colorEnum cases: .Red: 0xFF0000, .Green: 0x00FF00, .Blue: 0x0000FF, default: 0xFFFFFF)  
```

Also it is desirable for "cases:" to be available in the switch statement: 

``` swift
  let color : Int
  switch colorEnum { 
    cases:  .Red: color = 0xFF0000,
            .Green: color = 0x00FF00,
            .Blue: color = 0x0000FF,
    default: color = 0xFFFFFF
  }
```
One nice thing about this is that the duplication of the "case:" does not have to be there thus making the statement cleaner. 

To make the difference between expressions and statements clear, statements will continue to require braces after the conditional and "else" if present, and expressions will not. Also, this last example shows why it is desirable for switch expressions to exist, there is much less duplicated code assigning to color in the expression case and type inference is able to determine the type of color automatically. 

## Detailed design

Describe the design of the solution in detail. If it involves new
syntax in the language, show the additions and changes to the Swift
grammar. If it's a new API, show the full API and its documentation
comments detailing what it does. The detail in this section should be
sufficient for someone who is *not* one of the authors to be able to
reasonably implement the feature.

## Impact on existing code

All places where the ternary operator is used would need to be replaced with if...then...else. The Convert To Latest Swift Syntax in Xcode would ease this transition. Everything else is optional to use. 

## Alternatives considered

The biggest question was why does Swift not already support the result of the "if" statement or "switch" as part of the existing staement? You could simply allow:

``` swift
let result = if conditional { X } else { Y }. 
```

The problem with this is that in expressions all cases must be handled. In a statement it is common to not have else. So you could make it an expression if the return value is used. This makes it more complex from both the user's perspective and the compiler perspective. That means that if you were to change a "if" conditional into an expression suddenly you would get an an error if the "else" part was not provided. 

Another problem is the proliferation of braces, expressions should be light, it looks cumbersome to have braces all through your expressions. It does not look as clean having braces in an expression. Further it will help express the difference between an expression and a statement to only use braces for statements. For example:

``` swift
let color = switch enumColor {
  case .Red: (switch shade {case: .DarkRed: 0xFFEEEE
                            case: .LightRed:0xFF0000
                            default: 0xFF1010 } )
}
```
