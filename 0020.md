# Feature Replacement of Ternary Operator with "if...then...else" and Adding "switch" expresions

## Introduction

The ternary operator has existed in C like languages for some time. For anyone reading it, who is not familiar with it, it is hard to understand what its purpose is, however it provides an important feature, which is creating an expression based upon a conditional expression. This proposal addresses that shortcoming and also allows switch expressions in a compact way.

Swift-evolution thread: [ternary operator ?: suggestion ](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20151207/000810.html)

## Motivation

The main purpose is to replace the ternary operator with something that reads better and yet still maintains that functionality at the same time allow switch to be used in expression contexts. With this approach type inference can figure out what to initally conditionally assign a variable, with statements this is not possible. Statements can also consist of mutiple sub-statements, which is not possible with an expression. 

## Proposed solution

Background: expressions and statements are inheriently different. For example, in a statement it is perfectly fine to have no "else" clause but in an expression it must always have "else" to initialize the variable. Trying to make the existing statements into expressions will add complexity, clutter, and will be confusing to users. Please see "Alternatives Considered" section for details. 

First the ternary "?:" operators would be removed from the language, replaced with the if...then...else expression, (the language conversion tools would automate this process). For example:

``` swift
  result = if condition then expression1 else expression2 
```  

for multiline expressions may be useful for more complex expressions:

``` swift
  result = if condition 
        then expression1 
        else expression2
```
where the if...then...else clause requires all three keywords. This will help to differentiate it from a statement. 

The swtich statement can also be treated as an expression: 

``` swift
  result = switch pattern cases: label1: expression1, label2: expression2, ... labelN: expressionN, default: expressionD  
```
if all cases in the enum are covered the "default:" keyword can be omitted. Note that the "cases:" keyword provides a way to list the cases after the switch more compactly. 

For example:

``` swift
  color = switch colorEnum cases: .Red: 0xFF0000, .Green: 0x00FF00, .Blue: 0x0000FF, default: 0xFFFFFF  
```

for multiline expressions:

``` swift
  color = switch colorEnum 
    cases:  .Red: 0xFF0000, 
            .Green: 0x00FF00, 
            .Blue: 0x0000FF,
    default: 0xFFFFFF  
```

Note that any of these expressions can be surrounded by parenthesis to make clear that the expression returns a value but it is not required. 

``` swift
  let color = (switch colorEnum cases: .Red: 0xFF0000, .Green: 0x00FF00, .Blue: 0x0000FF, default: 0xFFFFFF)  
```

One nice thing about this is that the duplication of the "case:" does not have to be there thus making the statement cleaner and since each case must return only one value from its expression, putting "case:" in front of each is not necessary. In switch statements a "case:" is required because multiple statements can exist afer each case.  

To make the difference between expressions and statements clear, statements will continue to require braces after the conditional and "else" if present, and expressions will not. Also, this last example shows why it is desirable for switch expressions to exist, there is much less duplicated code assigning to "color" in the expression case and type inference is able to determine the type of color automatically. Cases in a switch statement can have multiple statements within each part with expressions you would not be able to that with a switch expression. 

All expressions must match the result type and for type inference, expressions must be the same result type. If you want something else it will not automatically find a more generic type, for example this would generate an error: 

``` swift
  let result = switch value 
      cases:  1: "String", 
              2: 52, 
      default:  nil
```

will not automatically create an Any? for result. They must specify the more generic type on the left hand side. 

``` swift
  let result : Any? = switch value 
      cases:  1: "String", 
              2: 52, 
      default:  nil
```

## Detailed design



## Impact on existing code

All places where the ternary operator is used would need to be replaced with if...then...else. The Convert To Latest Swift Syntax in Xcode would ease this transition. Everything else is optional to use. 

## Alternatives considered

The biggest question was why does Swift not already support the result of the "if" statement or "switch" as part of the existing staement? You could simply allow:

``` swift
let result = if conditional { X } else { Y }. 
```

The problem with this is that in expressions all cases must be handled. In a statement it is common to not have else. So you could make it an expression if the return value is used. This makes it more complex from both the user's perspective and the compiler perspective. That means that if you were to change a "if" conditional into an expression suddenly you would get an an error if the "else" part was not provided. 

Another problem is the proliferation of braces, expressions should be light, it looks cumbersome to have braces all through your expressions. It does not look as clean having braces in an expression and you would never use braces in a ternary expression. Further it will help express the difference between an expression and a statement to only use braces for statements. For example:

``` swift
let color = switch enumColor {
  case .Red: (switch shade {case: .DarkRed: 0xFFEEEE
                            case: .LightRed:0xFF0000
                            default: 0xFF1010 } )
  default: 0xFFFFFF
}
```

note that the commas for each case are not necessary with this example but does look significanly more like Lisp :-)

Finally switch statements can have multiple statements after them, that is not the case for expressions, only one sub-expression can be in each part of the case. There is ambiguity if a the existing statement could have multiple statements in it. 

``` swift
let color = switch enumColor {
  case .Red: (switch shade {case: func1(); 
                                  x = 15 
                                  40 
                            case: func3() 
                                  13 x = 10
                            default: func2()
                            } )
  default: 0xFFFFFF
}
```

Switch statements can't use cases because each case can have multiple cases: 

``` swift
  let color : Int
  switch colorEnum { 
    case:  .Red: color = 0xFF0000
    case:  .Green: color = 0x00FF00,
    case:  .Blue: color = 0x0000FF,
    default: color = 0xFFFFFF
  }
```

the expression would use one cases "cases:" clause and not repeated "case:" as this adds nothing except noise. The following would not be allowed;   

``` swift
  color = switch colorEnum case: .Red: 0xFF0000, case: .Green: 0x00FF00, case: .Blue: 0x0000FF, default: 0xFFFFFF  
```

Use of then in switch, for details see thread. 

Also considered ways of not adding additional keywords. As it may be unclear when to use "then" or not, this is addressed in two ways. It is invalid to have "then" without "else". Statements must be surrounded in braces as they can be mutiple lines long. Just using "case:" does not read as clearly as "cases:" and "if...then...else" is clearer.

We tried putting in syntax like

``` swift
  color = if conditional "string1" else "string2"  
```

This leads to syntactic ambiguity, by adding "then" that goes away.
